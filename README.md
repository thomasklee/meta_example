# meta_example

In wanting to provide university students with a tool for creating forest plots, funnel plots and other elements of meta-analysis, and having only two sessions for doing so, I put together two R scripts for students with no previous R experience. The first script, `analysis/basic_operations.R`, provides an easy introduction to some basic concepts in R, such as creating and manipulating objects. The other, `analysis/meta-analysis-example.R`, introduces some basic functions of the wonderful and easy-to-use `meta` package (Schwarzer, Carpenter & Rucker, 2015). Both scripts can be found in the `analysis` folder while the data file used in the meta-analysis can be found in the `data` folder.
