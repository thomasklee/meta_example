# meta_example

In wanting to provide university students with a tool for creating forest plots, funnel plots and other elements of meta-analysis, and having only two sessions for doing so, I put together two R scripts for students with no previous R experience. The first script, `analysis/basic_operations.R`, provides an easy introduction to some basic concepts in R, such as creating and manipulating objects. The other, `analysis/meta-analysis-example.R`, introduces some basic functions of the wonderful, and easy-to-use, `meta` (Schwarzer,
Carpenter & Rucker, 2015)  package. Both scripts can be found in the analysis folder. The data folder contains spreadsheets and CSV files, one of which (`analysis/data/law2004_fig3_data.csv`) is used in the meta-analysis script. I'll be adding more to this repository later.
