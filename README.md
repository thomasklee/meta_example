# meta_example

In wanting to provide university students with a tool for creating forest plots, funnel plots and other elements of meta-analysis, and having only two sessions to do so, I put together two R scripts for those with no previous experience with R. The first script, `analysis/basic_operations.R`, provides an easy introduction to some basic concepts in R, such as creating and manipulating objects. The other, `analysis/meta-analysis-example.R`, introduces some basic functions of the wonderful and easy-to-use `meta` package (Schwarzer, 2007). Both scripts can be found in the `analysis` folder while the data file used in the meta-analysis can be found in the `data` folder. Resulting forest below.
