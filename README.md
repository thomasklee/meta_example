# meta_example

## The challenge
Provide my students with a tool for creating forest plots, funnel plots and other elements of meta-analysis in two sessions. 

## The background 
Most students were gearing up to do a meta-analysis for the first time based on a clinical question of interest to them. They'd previously had an introductory lecture on meta-analsis but none had any experience with R. 

## The response
Two descriptive R scripts that can be used by those with no previous experience with R. The first, `analysis/basic_operations.R`, is a gentle, hands-on introduction to some basic concepts in R, such as creating and manipulating objects. The other, `analysis/meta-analysis-example.R`, introduces some basic functions of the wonderful and easy-to-use `meta` package (Schwarzer, 2007). Both scripts can be dowloaded from the `analysis` folder above. The data file used in the meta-analysis can be downloaded from the `analysis/data` folder. There are also two short documents in the `handouts` folder: (1) an instructions for downloading and installing R and RStudio and (2) some resources for doing meta-analysis with R. Hope you find them useful. 

One of the forest plots from the second R script can be seen below.
